3. **Batch Generation**: Generate multiple keys at once
4. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor generation times and security scores

## Troubleshooting

### EasyOCR Issues
- **Import Errors**: Run `python test_easyocr.py` to diagnose
- **Model Download**: First run may download OCR models (requires internet)
- **Memory Issues**: Ensure sufficient RAM for OCR processing

### Crypto Generation Issues
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check `pip list` for cryptography packages
- **Key Size Errors**: Ensure key sizes are valid for chosen algorithms
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor system resources during generation

### Flask Application Issues
- **Port Conflicts**: Change port in `app_flask.py` if 5000 is busy
- **File Upload Errors**: Check file size limits and supported formats
- **Template Errors**: Ensure all HTML templates are properly formatted

## Performance Considerations

### OCR Processing
- **Image Size**: Larger images take longer to process
- **Text Density**: Images with more text require more processing time
- **Model Loading**: First OCR operation may be slower due to model initialization

### Key Generation
- **Key Size**: Larger keys take longer to generate
- **Algorithm**: RSA keys take longer than AES keys
- **Batch Size**: Generating many keys simultaneously increases total time
